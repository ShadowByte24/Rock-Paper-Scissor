# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

A fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer!

This project includes:
- A web-based version with a modern UI (in `main` branch)
- A simple console-based version (in `console-version` branch)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🖥️ UI Version (Main Branch)
- Play until either you or the computer reaches **5 points**
- Score and round number update live

- I will make it more interactive, I have just implemented the logic will beautfiy it after sometime :)

### 🧾 Console Version (console-version Branch)
- Game runs in the console for **5 fixed rounds**
- Outputs the result of each round and overall winner

Switch to the console version:
```bash
git checkout console-version
